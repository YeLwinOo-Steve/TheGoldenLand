The Buddha image is 66 metres (217 ft) long, and one of the largest in Burma.The construction was sponsored by a wealthy Burmese Buddhist, Sir Po Tha, in 1899. The image was completed in 1907 by another construction company, but was not proportioned correctly, and the Buddha's face had an aggressive expression.In the 1950s, the old Buddha image was demolished and temple trustees began work to replace the image, under the supervision of U Thaung, a master craftsman from Tavoy (now Dawei). Large glass eyes with dimensions of 1.77 by .58 metres (5 ft 10 in × 1 ft 11 in) were custom-created at Naga Glass Factory. The Buddha image was consecrated in 1973.</p>

It is a small pagoda (7.3 metres (24 ft)) built on the top of a granite boulder covered with gold leaves pasted on by its male devotees.According to legend, the Golden Rock itself is precariously perched on a strand of the Buddha's hair. The balancing rock seems to defy gravity, as it perpetually appears to be on the verge of rolling down the hill. The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. Another legend states that a Buddhist priest impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial king used his supernatural powers to carry the rock to its current place, specifically choosing the rock for its resemblance to the monk's head.</p>

                            <p>The 2478 stupas at Kakku are one of the most remarkable sights in Shan State. Arranged in neat rows sprawling over the hillside, local legend has it that the stupa garden was founded by the Buddhist missionaries of the Indian emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. As such, the stupas span a bewildering variety of styles, marking the prevailing architectural trends when they were constructed. Some are simple and unadorned while others are covered in a riot of stucco deities and mythical beasts. Among the tall Shan-style stupas are a number of small square ‘monastery style’ stupas that are unique to this region.</p>

There are four covered stairways called saungdan leading up the hill from the south, southeast, west and north, and convenient seats of masonry work line these stairways all the way up.</p>
